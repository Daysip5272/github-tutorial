Git:  
* version of control(snapshot of code)
* not required github
* runs in command line
* you have a directory (folder) of files

Github:  
store in cloud
visually changes
easily collaborate on files 
github.com website 
runs in command line  
to interact with repositories & visually  see changes between commits
